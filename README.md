# Personal Website Starter

This folder contains a ready-to-upload one-page personal site.
Just drop these files into your GitHub repo named `yourusername.github.io` and enable GitHub Pages.

## Quick Deploy
1. Create a repo named **yourusername.github.io**.
2. Upload `index.html` (and optionally `cv.pdf`).
3. In **Settings â†’ Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and select `main` and `/ (root)`.
4. Visit `https://yourusername.github.io`.

## Customize
- Edit text in `index.html` (search for sections: About, Research, Publications, etc.).
- Replace the email link (`you@example.com`).
- Upload your `cv.pdf` to have the header CV button work.
- Add images (e.g., `/assets/`) and link them inside the HTML.
